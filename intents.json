Please note, deferred exams may affect academic decisions and progress. Once you have completed an exam, no further requests for special consideration will be granted.\n\nIf the reason for missing your exam is medical, please use the approved McMaster University Medical Form. You will need to be seen by a doctor at the earliest possible date, normally on or before the date of the missed exam. The doctor must verify the duration of your illness. If the reason for missing your exam is non-medical, relevant official documentation is required within five working days.\n\nPlease check with your Faculty Office for a decision on your request. If a deferral is granted, “DEF” will appear in Mosaic (My Academics > Grades). Deferred examinations are written during the next deferred exam period. Default of the deferred exam will result in a fail for that exam.\n\nIf you are granted more than one deferred exam, you may be required to reduce your course load by your Faculty/Program Office during the term in which the deferred exams are being written. The reduced load decision will be made and communicated along with the deferred exam request decision. If you have been granted one or more deferred exams, a hold may be placed on your record in following terms. The hold will remain until all deferred exam(s) are completed and your academic standing is calculated. You will be notified of this decision by your Faculty/Program Office or through Mosaic > Student Centre > View My Grades.\n\nFor more information, visit https://registrar.mcmaster.ca/exams-grades/exams/#tab-20"

The plan enrolment dates vary from semester to semester. Even if you have already enrolled in a current term's payment plan, you will still need to re-apply for the payment plan option for the next term during those dates. $80 will be added to the first installment of each term you are enrolled in the plan. \n\nTo be eligible, you must be a new, incoming students. Current students with no prior balance owing from a previous term. If you have an outstanding balance on your student account, please contact student.billing@mcmaster.ca.\n\nHow to Enroll:\n1. Log in to Mosaic > Student Centre > Finances > Other financial > Payment plans.\n2. Select the fall term payment plan to continue.\n3. Review the instalments.\n4.

There are certain circumstances where we would accept a refund request mid-session (e.g. a withdraw, over-payment in error, etc.). Credits for dropped/cancelled courses and over-payments are first applied against other debt owed to the university (e.g. residence, meal plan, miscellaneous and Campus Store charges appearing on the account).\n\nPlease note: Students in the McMaster-Conestoga or McMaster-Mohawk Nursing program do not pay fees to McMaster and must request refunds from Conestoga or Mohawk.\n\nStep 1: Request a refund\n\nPlease visit (https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=B2M3RCm0rUKMJSjNSW9HctJuRDxJs05Juqi9m8DMf1ZUMDVXRkY0UkcxQ0I3WVQ4OVc1UkE0RVY4Si4u) to complete the refund request form. You will need to login using your McMaster email address (MacID@mcmaster.ca) even if you no longer have access to it.\n\nDue to the high volume of refund requests, please allow 4 to 6 weeks for processing. Cheques will only be processed in extenuating circumstances. Ensure your address information is correct in Mosaic.\n\nStep 2: Receiving your refund\nStudents with a Canadian bank account:\nRefunds are processed via Interac e-transfer to your McMaster email address. Please monitor your inbox and junk/spam folder. You will receive an email directing you to log in to your online banking to make a deposit (it does not need to be sent to the email address associated with the student's bank account in order to accept).\n\nInternational refunds:\nIf you used Convera (formerly Western Union) or CIBC International as your original method of payment, we will work with you to coordinate your refund.\n\nPayMyTuition refunds for international students:\n1. You will receive an email from PayMyTuition (studentrefunds@paymytuition.com).\n2. You may choose to deposit the funds into someone else's bank account. When you are directed to the PayMyTuition refund form, you will have the option within the Beneficiary Information tab to select someone else as the recipient and input their bank information.\n3. Enter beneficiary details: Complete the online refund beneficiary instruction form which requires currency, identification documentation (either passport or driver's license), banking and beneficiary information.\n4. Complete verification: Upon receipt of your completed beneficiary instructions, PayMyTuition will verify your request for accuracy. They will complete fraud and compliance checks to comply with various anti-money laundering and compliance laws.\n5. Payment confirmation: PayMyTuition will send you a confirmation email once your beneficiary information has been verified and approved. You will receive a PDF summary that is password protected. This PDF can be accessed using the bank account number that you provided in Step 2 as the password.\n6. Refund processed: Once your refund has been processed, you will receive a notification that your refund is complete. Please allow 3-5 business days for the payment to be deposited to your account."

If you would like to authorize someone to pick up your diploma on your behalf, you must submit a Service Request in Mosaic, and in the comments indicate the full name and date of birth of the authorized person. They will be required to present valid, government photo ID.\n\nFor a required fee, you can request a duplicate or replacement degree parchment, diploma or certificate. A second copy of the degree parchment, diploma or certificate will be reissued (noting the date of reissue) when the original document has been lost, damaged or destroyed. The words duplicate or reissued (will also indicate the print date) will be affixed to all degree parchments, diplomas or certificates requested in this manner.

Visit https://mcmaster.awardspring.ca and sign in with your MacID and password.\n2. Fill out the General Application. Formerly called the “Common Application,” this short questionnaire asks about your program and background so AwardSpring can create a personalized list of awards just for you. It takes less than 15 minutes to complete.\n3. Complete your Follow-ups. On AwardSpring's Dashboard, you will find a “Follow-ups” section. This is where you apply for individual awards with extra criteria like references, essays, etc. Complete these before the application deadline listed on the award. If the award requires a reference, finish the Follow-ups early to give your referee time to respond.\n4. Keep checking back. Awards appear in AwardSpring throughout the school year, starting with bursaries in the fall and scholarships on January 1. Make sure you check back frequently to see what new awards are available.\n5. Collect your money! Awards will be applied directly to your student account. Any leftover will then be paid out to you directly.\n\nFor more details, including timelines and FAQs, visit https://registrar.mcmaster.ca/awardspring-guide/"

                "Applications for deferrals will open in mid-July. McMaster will normally only grant deferrals on offers of admission when there are special extenuating circumstances. Each case is evaluated on its own merit. A request for deferral (to the subsequent Fall term) will be considered under the following circumstances:\n1. the student has accepted their undergraduate offer of admission to the university; and\n2. all conditions outlined in the Offer of Admission letter have been met; and\n3. the student is not intending to return to secondary school or attend another post-secondary institution during the deferral period.\n\nHow to submit a deferral request:\n1. Log in to your Mosaic student portal.\n2. Click on the “Defer My Admission to McMaster” tile: Fill out the application along with details of your reason for the request (250 words or less).\n3. Once submitted, the Admissions and Faculty Offices will review it. The status of your request will be visible in Mosaic.\n4. Once a decision has been reached, you will receive an email indicating any next steps.\n\n. If your deferral request is approved, you will automatically be deregistered from classes and refunded any monies paid. You will not have an opportunity to enrol in classes again until next Fall semester. \n\nFor more details, visit https://registrar.mcmaster.ca/admission-deferrals/"
